		<h1>Stained Glass Style</h1>
		<p>This project was centered around the idea of adapting a scene from a book in an artistic way. I chose to adapt two specific scenes from J.R.R. Tolkien's <em>The Hobbit,</em> I want to work on more scenes in this kind of style, from other books or films. Visually striking scenes are the best in this style.</p>

		<br><strong>Chapter XIV: Fire and Water Page 227</strong>
		<br>Fire leaped from the dragon’s jaws. He circled for a while high in the air above them lighting all the lake; the trees by the shores shone like copper and like blood with leaping shadows of dense black at their feet. Then down he swooped straight through the arrow-storm, reckless in his rage, taking no heed to turn his scaly sides towards his foes, seeking only to set their town ablaze.

		<strong>Chapter VIII: Flies and Spiders Page 143</strong>
		<br>He was deep in thoughts of bacon and eggs and toast and butter when he felt something touch him. Something like a strong sticky string was against his left hand, and when he tried to move he found that his legs were already wrapped in the same stuff, so that 	   when he got up he fell over. Then the great spider, who had been busy tying him up while he dozed, came from behind him and came at him. He could only see the thing’s eyes, but he could feel its hairy legs as it struggled to wind its abominable threads round 	  and round him. It was lucky that he had come to his senses in time. Soon he would not have been able to move at all.

		<h1>3D Modeling</h1>
		<p>While I definitely don't specialize in 3D modeling, nor would I consider myself an expert in it, I had a lot of fun creating some characters in Maya. I had never modeled something in three dimensions before, so this was all very <strong>very</strong> new to me. Below the Stained Glass is my first finished project, where we had to build a table set, texture it, and light it. I'm very happy with how it came out, and I really spent a long time getting the lighting juuuust right. The candles didn't really have that waxy "sheen" but I think the lighting is what really pulls it all together. Below is concept art of two character models, alongside their finished Maya files, both 3D Printed out. The mushroom is based on an Inkcap mushroom, which after creating it gave it an almost "circus-like" feel. That led to the Ringmaster, which incorporated some mushroomy elements like the bulb at the top. It was absolutely insane getting to hold something I created on the computer in my hands. <br>P.S. Look closely at the candelabra.</p>

		<h1>This Website!</h1>
		<p>Funnily enough I'm also really proud of this website. I believe it shows off my silly nature just as well as my work does. I think the casualness works since I'm not a serious person in the slightest. I made it into a "corkboard" like design since I've always wanted a big corkboard to pin things up and maybe put string connecting the ideas together like a true conspiracy theorist would.  I made every element in Adobe Illustrator by mouse (and hand) and exported them as .pngs into Dreamweaver. All of the slideshows and popup windows were created using a tool called Bootstrap, an online collection of javascript you can use to make your website visually interesting.</p>

		<h1>My Dad the Football Star</h1>
			<p>This photoshop edit has a bit of a story behind it.<br></br>Early 2019 I really got into photo editing. I had access to expensive professional cameras so I made two edited photos that had myself "cloned" (also below). I was very proud of how they came out, so I sent them to my father. He, as a surprise gift got them framed, that meant so much to me. Later he suggested that I edit him into a picture with Tom Brady (he's a huge Patriots fan). I practically jumped at the idea, to pay him back. While the edit I made isn't my best work, it meant the world to my dad. I gave him a framed version and some coasters with him and Brady for Father's Day. He wouldn't stop telling everyone what I'd made for him, how this was the "best gift he's ever gotten." I'm just glad he forgot about it long enough for the gift to be a surprise.</p>

	<h1>Sous La Mer</h1>
		<p>This project was for Windham Hospital's "Sous La Mer" gala. The event was to raise money for the hospital and to honor some faculty members of esteem. I obviously wasn't invited, but was (along with my whole class) asked to make a poster for the event. The theme was Sous La Mer or <em>Under the Sea</em> in French, and they wanted it "elegant" and "not Disney-like." I've always been fascinated with Jellyfish, how they glow using bioluminescence, so I designed the poster around that and a quote by Jacques Cousteau. They chose my poster (along with the rest of the class) to show off, which was really awesome. </p>
