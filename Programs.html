		<h1>Adobe Products</h1>
		<p>Mainly due to the convience of a computer lab and of having free access to these programs, I have become pretty adept with Illustrator, Indesign, and Photoshop. I have used all 3 for around 6-7 years fairly regularly, and have used them all in some capacity to create pretty much everything you'll see on this website. I'm creating this website using Dreamweaver, another Adobe product, and while I'm new at all of this website shenanigans, I'm very happy with how it's coming out. Having the ability to see the changes you're making in real time really helps.</p>

		<h1>Maya</h1>
		<p>Having never used a 3D modeling program before, Maya was extremely challenging to use. I barely scratched the surface at what the program could do in the last few months, and I still feel like I haven't grasped the basics of it. However it was very satisfying printing the objects I created, and actually holding them in my hand was surreal. I'm not sure if I'll work with Maya professionally, but I might take another course around it if I have time for it. These programs are expensive after all!</p>

		<h1>"Student" Alternatives</h1>
		<p>When I'm not in school I don't have access to any of these "high end" programs, but I still want to expand my skillbase and knowledge, so I tend to seek out cheaper alternatives. Gimp is an excellent resource and almost as useful as photoshop! I play around with that when I want to make silly edits whenever I'm struck with inspiration. I also like to make music in my spare time <a href="https://soundcloud.com/matthew-buteau-774053390">Link to soundcloud here!</a> and have used GarageBand for years to really let my creative juices flow. Inspiration is hard but it's good to have the right tools when it does (eventually) hit!</p>
